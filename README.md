# ChannelZ

ChannelZ is a CLI tool for x86-64 Linux machines that simplifies the common task of encoding static web assets with Gzip and Brotli for production environments.



## Features

 * `gzip` and `brotli` are compiled into `channelz`; their binaries do not need to be separately installed;
 * It can be set against one or many files, one or many directories;
 * Paths can be specified as trailing command arguments, and/or loaded via text file (with one path per line) with the `-l` option;
 * Directory processing is recursive;
 * Processing is done in parallel with multiple threads for major speedups;
 * Appropriate file types are automatically targeted; no thinking involved!


The "appropriate" file types are:

 * css
 * eot
 * htm(l)
 * ico
 * js
 * json
 * mjs
 * otf
 * rss
 * svg
 * ttf
 * txt
 * xhtm(l)
 * xml
 * xsl



## Installation

This application is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and can be installed using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

For stable Rust (>= `1.47.0`), run:
```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-s" cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/Blobfolio/channelz.git \
    --bin channelz \
    --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Pre-built `.deb` packages are also added for each [release](https://github.com/Blobfolio/channelz/releases/latest). They should always work for the latest stable Debian and Ubuntu.



## Usage

It's easy. Just run `channelz [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <PATH(S)>…`.

The following flags and options are available:
```bash
-h, --help           Prints help information
-l, --list <list>    Read file paths from this list.
-p, --progress       Show progress bar while minifying.
-V, --version        Prints version information
```

For example:
```bash
# Generate app.js.gz and app.js.br:
channelz /path/to/app.js

# Tackle a whole folder at once with a nice progress bar:
channelz -p /path/to/assets

# Or load it up with a lot of places separately:
channelz /path/to/css /path/to/js …
```
